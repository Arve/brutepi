You need to put two files in this folder:

* left.wav -> FIR Impulse response file for left channel correction
* right.wav -> FIR Impulse response file for right channel correction

Both files need to be mono file in 32/44.1 wav format, such as exported from
Room EQ Wizard's "Export Filters Impulse Response as WAV"
